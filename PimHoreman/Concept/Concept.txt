Concept: I will combine Arkanoid with Pinball in this prototype.
Combining the pinball 'start' mechanic, whereby the ball will launch from the side into the game.
Also will there be pinball objectives where the ball can go in to for additional points.
add the bottom of the screen you don't have pinball flippers you have the arkanoid paddle to bounce the ball back up.
Upon losing the ball you have to insert the ball in the game again with the pinball mechanic.
